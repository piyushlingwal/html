    <h1>5 things every college student should do for future success</h1>
    <br>
    <div class="text">College is full of new and exciting opportunities, experiences, ideas and people.
        But it doesn’t last forever. Those four years
        (sometime more) fly by !<br>
        As college students nationwide begin the fall academic term – and high school students and their parents
        consider<br>
        college options – Creighton University experts offer five things every college student should do to get the most
        out of their<br>
        collegiate experience and prepare for future success.</div>

            <h2>1. Find A Mentor</h2><br>
            <p>College is the perfect time to learn how to find, engage and develop relationships<br> with mentors, says
                Jeremy
                Fisher, director of the John P. Fahey Career Center<br> at Creighton. “Having a mentor while in college
                allows
                students to develop both<br> personally and professionally,” Fisher says.<br><br>
                A mentor is someone who shares knowledge, advice, ideas and information, and<br> for many college
                students, professors
                and faculty advisers can naturally fall into<br> this role. Alumni, community contacts and professionals
                can also be
                sources of<br> mentors for students.</p>

        <h1>2. Engage in academic service-learning</h1>
        <br>
        <div class="span">What if we told you college students can increase their critical thinking skills, create
            connections with community members
            and address their awareness of social and cultural biases by taking one course? With academic
            service-learning, these
            outcomes are expected and more.Academic service-learning is an educational strategy that integrates
            community service and reflection with academic content.

            “Creighton students learn in multiple ways from service-learning,” says Thomas Kelly, Ph.D., director of the
            Office of Academic Service-Learning and professor of theology. “They gain hands-on experience by applying
            their course learning to the real world.”

            Students who take these types of courses report they are more interested and engaged with class materials,
            and demonstrate high levels of self-awareness and personal growth.

            Creighton has more than 60 courses with an academic service-learning component spanning a variety of fields,
            including business, social sciences, performing arts, dentistry and health sciences.

            “In these types of classes, students have learned French language skills by working directly with refugees;
            developed public relations skills by creating communication plans for public health nonprofits; and applied
            business and technology solutions to address poverty,” Kelly says.

            And, the benefits of academic service-learning don’t stop with the students – they greatly impact
            communities. In the last academic year, Creighton students partnered with more than 120 community
            organizations.
